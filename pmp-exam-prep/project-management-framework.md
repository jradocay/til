# Project Management Framework

## Definition of a Project
Temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.  
_(NOT operational work - ongoing work to support the business)_

## What is Project Management?
The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements

**Process Groups (5):**
1. Initiating  
2. Planning  
3. Executing  
4. Monitoring & Controlling  
5. Closing  

**Knowledge Areas:**
1. Integration  
2. Scope  
3. Time  
4. Cost  
5. Quality  
6. Human Resources  
7. Communications  
8. Risk  
9. Procurement

## Organizational Project Management (OPM)
Provides a strategic framework to use and guide portfolio, program, and project management to deliver organizational strategy.  Assume this organizational framework is in place.

## Portfolio Management
Projects, programs, subportfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.  Aligns with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects, prioritizing the work, and providing the needed resources.  Projects or programs may not necessarily be interdependent or directly related.

## Program Management
Coordinates the management of related projects, subprograms, and program activities to achieve specific benefits that support the organization's strategic goals.  Projects within a program are related through the common outcome or collective capability (harmonized).

## Project Management
Develops and implements plans to achieve specific scope that is driven by the objectives of the program or portfolio it is subjected to and ultimately to organizational strategic goals.

## OPML3
PMI's organizational project management maturity model

## Project Management Office (PMO)
Management structure to centralizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, and techniques.  Natural liason between the organization's portfolios, programs, and projects.

-**Supportive:**  
..- Consultative
..- Recommends policies, methodologies, templates, and lessons learned
..- Project repository
..- Low level of control

-**Controlling:**  
..- Ensures compliance
..- Provides support and guidance, trains others, assists with specific tools
..- Moderate level of control

**Directive:**  
..- Takes control
..- Provides project managers for different projects and is responsible for the priority & results of all projects
..- High level of control

## Constraints
As a project manager, you must juggle many things on a project, including project contraints like **quality, scope, cost, time, resources, risk, and customer satisfaction** that limit options.  Constraints help evaluate competing demands.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders are any people or organizations whose interests may be positively or negatively impacted by the project or its product.  Includes members of the project team.

## Stakeholder Management
Treating stakeholders like assistant team members means you keep them informed, solicit their input, and work to satisfy their needs and expectations.  Without this effort, the project may fail.

## Organizational Structure
Projects are impacted by the cultural norms, management policies, and procedures of the organizations of which they are a part.
**Functional:**  Silo.  Grouped by areas of specialization (accounting, marketing, etc.)  Team members complete project work in addition to departmental work.  Communication stays within the department.
Advantages:
1. Easier management of specialists
2. Team members report to only one supervisor
3. Similar resources are centralized, as the company is grouped by specialists
4. Clearly defined career paths in areas of specialization
Disadvantages:
1. People place more emphasis on their functional specialty to the detriment of the project
2. No career path in project management
3. The project manager has little or no authority

**Projectized:**  No home.  Grouped by project with the project manager in control of the project.  Personnele are assigned to and report to the project manager.  Communication stays within the project.  Personnel must find another project after the work is done.
Advantages:
1. Efficient project organization
2. Team loyalty to the project
3. More effective communications than functional
Disadvantages:
1. No "home" for team members when project is completed
2. Lack of specialization in disciplines
3. Duplication of facilities and job functions
4. May result in less efficient use of resources

**Matrix:** Two bosses.  Team members report to both project manager and functional supervisor.  Communication goes from team members to both bosses.  Team members do project work and departmental work.
Advantages:
1. Highly visible project objectives
2. Improved project manager control over resources
3. More support from functional areas
4. Maximum utilization of scarce resources
5. Better coordination
6. Better horizontal and vertical dissemination of information
7. Team members maintain a "home"
Disadvantages:
1. Extra administration is required
2. Project team members have more than one boss
3. More complex to monitor and control
4. Resource allocation is more complex
5. Extensive policies and procedures are needed
6. Functional managers may have different priorities than project managers
7. Higher potential for conflict

**Project Expediter:**  acts as a staff assistant and communications coordinator.  Cannot personally make or enforce decisions.

**Project Coordinator:**  has some power to make decisions, some authority, and reports to a higher-level manager.

## Organizational Hierarchy
Operational, middle management, strategic

## Enterprise Environmental Factors
Company "baggage" (culture and existing systems) that the project will have to deal with.

## Organizational Process Assets
Processes, procedures, and historical information.
**Lessions learned** document what went righ and wrong; include:
- Technical aspects of the project - What was right and wrong about how we completed the work to produce the product?
- Project Management - How did we do with the WBS creation, risk planning, etc?
- Management - How did I do with communications and leadership as a project manager?
(both an input and an output of projects)

## Work Performance Data
Initial measurements and details about activities gathered during project work (executing).

## Work Performance Information
Result of analyzing work performance data to make sure it conforms to the project management plan (controlling).

## Work Performance Reports
Reports distributed to stakeholders as an output of monitoring & controlling.

## Project Life Cycle (Methodology)
What you need to do to do the work
1. **Predictive:** plan-driven; waterfall or traditional life cycle/methodology
2. **Change-driven:** adaptive, iterative, agile, incremental life cycle/methodology.  Involved fixed time and cost but scope is broadly defined and refined as the project progresses.

## Project Management Process
What you need to do to manage the work
Initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, closing
