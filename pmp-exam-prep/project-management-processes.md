## Initiating
**Started because of business need or beginning a new phase of the project or the project as so many problems that you need to re-evaluate the business need.**  

- Select project manager  
- Determine company culture and existing systems  
- Collect processes, procedures, and historical information  
- Divide large projects into phases  
- Understand the business case  
- Uncover initial requirements, assumptions, risks, constraints, and existing agreements  
- Assess project and product feasibility within the given constraints  
- Create measurable objectives  
- **Develop project charter**  
- **Identify stakeholders** and determine their expectations, influence, and impact

## Planning
**Started because project initiating is completed.**  
**PM and team perform a detailed analysis of whether the objectives in the project charter can be achieved.  They then decided how the project will be accomplished, addresssing all appropriate processes and knowledge areas.  The results of the planning effort are the proejct management plan and project documents that will guide the execution and control of the project.**  
**Planning is iterative (after risk analysis).**  

_(in order of completion)_  
- Determine how you will plan for each knowledge area  
- Determine detailed requirements  
- Create project scope statement  
- Assess what to purchase and create procurement documents  
- Determine planning team  
- Create WBS and WBS dictionary  
- Create activity list  
- Create network diagram  
- Estimate resource requirements  
- Estimate time and cost  
- Determine critical path  
- Develop schedule  
- Develop budget  
- Determine quality standards, processes, and metrics  
- Create process improvement plan  
- Determine all roles and responsibilities  
- Plan communications and stakeholder engagement  
- Perform risk identification, qualitative risk analysis, and risk response planning  
- Go back - iterations  
- Finalize procurement documents  
- Create change management plan  
- Finalize the "how to execute and control" parts of all management plans  
- Develop realistic and final PM plan and performance measurement baseline  
- Gain formal approval of the plan  
- Hold kickoff meeting
