**Started because project initiating is completed.**  
**PM and team perform a detailed analysis of whether the objectives in the project charter can be achieved.  They then decided how the project will be accomplished, addresssing all appropriate processes and knowledge areas.  The results of the planning effort are the proejct management plan and project documents that will guide the execution and control of the project.**
